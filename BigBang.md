# The Big Bang might have never happened

[category Science][tags universe]

I never blog about science but I have to break my rule today, because this is such a ground-breaking discovery -- the Big Bang might have never happened! So today I'm creating a new category, [Science](https://sfxpt.wordpress.com/category/science/), and blog about the Big Bang.

A [new study](http://www.digitaljournal.com/science/the-big-bang-never-happened-the-universe-had-no-beginning/article/425708) suggests that there has not been such a thing as the Big Bang, and the universe has always been having **no beginning and no end**.

I've always been questioning how it is ever possible for such massive and endless universe could ever have been a singularity (an eminently dense and incredibly tiny mass). Think about it, at the moment of Big Bang, the whole endless universe just happens to be entirely empty everywhere, except at one single point, the singularity, which contain everything that consisting the nowadays universe. This has never make any sense to me.

So how the [Big Bang theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) come into inception? Well it definitely [based on solid fact and observation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Overview):

> Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.[14] According to the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not the center of the Universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the Universe are receding from all others. 

Deducing this expansion backward, it will inevitably arrive to the conclusion that such expansion has to be originated from a single point, some 13.8 billion years ago, the singularity, and the Big Bang. Everything seems so logical, even though the conclusion seems absurd. So what might go wrong? The the [above article](http://www.digitaljournal.com/science/the-big-bang-never-happened-the-universe-had-no-beginning/article/425708) might give the anwser. The following are mainly excerpted from it. 

Ali and Das, from Benha University and University of Lethbridge in Alberta, are directly challenging the orthodox theory upheld by the majority of scientists, who believe that the universe began 13.8 billion years ago after the singularity exploded, creating everything which exists. They claimed to have proved by quantum equations that **something must have come before it**. If correct, they will have answered one of the greatest enigmas in theoretical physics. The new model also challenges the notion of a Big Crunch, which says that the universe will eventually collapse in on itself and return to the state of a new singularity.

Ahmed Farag Ali of Benha University and the Zewail City of Science and Technology in Egypt told Phys.org that *"The Big Bang singularity is the most serious problem of general relativity because the laws of physics appear to break down there."*

Das, the co-author of the paper published in Physics Letters B, says that their work resolves the riddle of the Big Bang and the inconsistencies in general relativity by proving that **the universe is infinite**.

Their research is not some fringe study, but is based on *sound theoretical physics*. In particular, they followed the work of one the greatest theoretical physicists of the 20th century, David Bohm. He endeavored to replace classical geodesics (the shortest path between two points on a curved surface) with quantum trajectories.

According to Phys.org, *"Ali and Das applied these Bohmian trajectories to an equation developed in the 1950s by physicist Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri at Presidency University in Kolkata, India. Raychaudhuri was also Das's teacher when he was an undergraduate student of that institution in the '90s."*

Ali and Das' model avoids singularities because of the major difference between classical geodesics and Bohmian trajectories. *"Classical geodesics eventually cross each other,"* says Phy.org, *"and the points at which they converge are singularities. In contrast, Bohmian trajectories never cross each other, so singularities do not appear in the equations."*

The researches explains, the "quantum corrections" terms **keep the universe at a finite size and therefore give it an infinite age**, which *"agree closely with current observations of the cosmological constant and density of the universe."*

In an another paper, Das and Rajat Bhaduri of McMaster University, Canada, have given more credence to the new model. They propose that gravitons are able to form a **Bose-Einstein condensate** at temperatures which the universe has had **throughout its existence**.
