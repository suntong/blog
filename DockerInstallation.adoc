= Docker Installation

:blogpost-categories: Debian,Ubuntu,Docker,LXC,virtualization,containerization

The +Docker+ is so new and constantly changing that even its official installation guide page for Ubuntu, http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/ubuntulinux/, is not the simplest method. It's not complicated at all, just that there are more simple ways out there that are not officially documented. So,

If you want to install Docker for Ubuntu, the easiest way is:

pass::[<!--more-->]

== Docker installation for Ubuntu

[source,shell]
-------------------------
# Install the cgroup dependency to avoid hassle later
sudo apt-get install cgroup-lite

#Add the PPA sources to your apt sources list.
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties && sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dotcloud/lxc-docker

# Update your sources
sudo apt-get update

# Install, you will see another warning that the package cannot be authenticated. Confirm install.
sudo apt-get install lxc-docker
-------------------------

NB, most installation guides hinted that cgroup is necessary but didn't put it in the installation steps. If you don't have cgroup pre-installed, you will get the following at the end of lxc-docker installation:

-------------------------
lxc-start: Error setting devices.deny to a for lxc/db597c3bd13b089294814d19fc0908bfa1ad15fbd2cb133d2d730912e9a47635

lxc-start: failed to setup the cgroups for 'db597c3bd13b089294814d19fc0908bfa1ad15fbd2cb133d2d730912e9a47635'
lxc-start: failed to spawn 'db597c3bd13b089294814d19fc0908bfa1ad15fbd2cb133d2d730912e9a47635'
-------------------------

Some side notes, 

- I first attempted to install Docker under Ubuntu 13.10, but get some strange errors, then I installed Docker under Ubuntu 13.04, which is the one used by Docker developers, and it went flawless.
- Docker only support 64bit machines, and won't install under 32bit hosts.

== Docker installation for other distros

Docker installation for other distros can be as simple as:

 curl -sL https://get.docker.io/ | sh

Of course, you'd better have the cgroup pre-installed as well. 

This was actually what I did for my Ubuntu installation, because I was not aware of the above simpler method by then. It uses the following apt source, instead of the above PPA:

  deb https://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main

== Test the Docker installation

Now we have Docker successfully installed, it's time to do some testing:

[source,shell]
-------------------------
# Verify the daemon is running and you can connect to it. 
# If you see which version is running you know you are all set.
$ docker version
Client version: 0.5.3
Server version: 0.5.3
Go version: go1.1

$ docker ps

-------------------------

Once you start a process in Docker from an Image, Docker fetches the image and its Parent Image, and repeats the process until it reaches the Base Image. Then the Union File System adds a read-write layer on top. That read-write layer, plus the information about its Parent Image and some additional information like its unique id, networking configuration, and resource limits is called a container. +
