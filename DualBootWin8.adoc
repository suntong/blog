= Dual Boot Windows 8 UEFI with Ubuntu

:blogpost-categories: Debian,Ubuntu,linux,boot,partition,UEFI

This is about making it possible to dual boot Windows 8 UEFI with Ubuntu. There are lots of such blogs/posts on the Internet already, so why another one? The reason is mainly two folds:

- Many of them aren't clear whether their Windows 8 is booted with UEFI or not. 
- And most importantly, there are also lots of posts/questions that their systems are toasted, after trying. 

I kind of like to know *all* the "dangers" before jumping into the water. So I "looked", before I leaped. Now I'd like to share out what I've "looked" so far, so as to make the next person's life a bit easier, if s/he wants to dual boot Windows 8 UEFI with Ubuntu as well. 

My findings are posted at http://goo.gl/5dR4Ty, or
