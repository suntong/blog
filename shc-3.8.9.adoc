= shc-3.8.9 is not usable

:blogpost-categories: linux

Well, shc-3.8.9 *is* usable. The +make test+ test passes without any problem. So what make it not usable to me?

pass::[<!--more-->]

It is not usable to me because the shc-3.8.9 compiled executable can't be run in shell script. Take a look at the +test.bash+ file that comes with shc:

-----------------------------
cd shc-3.8.9

$ cat test.bash
#!/bin/bash -x
echo "\$@ is $@"
echo "command line: $0 $*"
echo "hello world"
# Added
echo "[$$] PAUSED... Hit return!"
read DUMMY
exit 0
-----------------------------

Now run its compiled executable:

-----------------------------
$ test.bash.x
+ echo '$@ is '
$@ is 
+ echo 'command line: ./test.bash.x '
command line: ./test.bash.x 
+ echo 'hello world'
hello world
+ echo '[9661] PAUSED... Hit return!'
[9661] PAUSED... Hit return!
+ read DUMMY

+ exit 0
-----------------------------

So far so good. Now let's see what will happen if the test.bash.x is put in shell script:

-----------------------------
$ cat testit
#!/bin/sh

set -x

echo test started
test.bash.x
echo test ended

$ ./testit 
+ echo test started
test started
+ test.bash.x
+ echo test started
test started
+ test.bash.x
+ echo test started
test started
+ test.bash.x
+ echo test started
test started
+ test.bash.x
...
-----------------------------

It will never stop. That's why it is not usable to me.

I tested its previous version, +shc-3.8.7+, and that was fine. So I'm not going to pack +shc-3.8.9+ but +shc-3.8.7+ instead.
