# Is this the year of the sheep or what?

[category Science][tags Chinese]

It first started from [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-31511109), then followed by [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/02/19/chinese-new-year-sheep-or-ram-orig-nws.cnn), then it goes viral [around](http://news.discovery.com/human/life/big-yang-theory-is-it-chinese-year-of-goat-or-sheep-150219.htm) [the](http://qz.com/346283/happy-lunar-new-year-but-is-it-the-year-of-the-sheep-or-something-else/) [world](http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2015/02/happy-lunar-new-year-but-is-it-the-year-of-the-sheep-or-the-goat.html) about the confusion: which exactly the year it is, goat or sheep?

The whole western media now seems to be all joking on the Chinese: *"Come on, make up your mind, don't confuse people any more"*. This makes me very uncomfortable, and want to defend the Chinese here. This is actually not a joke on Chinese, but in fact it should be a joke on English. Why?

Because in Chinese its meaning, yang (羊), has never ever been vague. That's the reason that [there is an article](http://culture.dwnews.com/news/2015-02-14/59635979.html) claims that “the Chinese Year of the Yang is driving the English-language media crazy”. I.e., the media in China have found their Western counterpart’s struggle to identify the meaning of yang laughable, and those “[so-called China experts](http://news.sohu.com/20150216/n409050331.shtml)” who were [trying to resolve the issue](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17761) are nothing but clowns.

The reason is that yang (**羊**) is the collective name for goat (山**羊**) or sheep (绵**羊**). So to Chinese, asking whether the year yang is year of goat or sheep, is the same as if you tell someone that this is the year of goat and s/he comes back with a question, is it a year of *domestic goat* or *wild goat*? If you tell them its domestic goat, then they will continue to ask, is it year of *does* or *rams*? In fact, there are [over 300 distinct breeds of goat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat#cite_note-hadog-1), so the question can goes on forever. Thus, you can see, the best answer to the question, is the collective name for all of them, becase [goat and sheep are closely related](#demystify). Both of them are in the [goat-antelope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat-antelope "Goat-antelope") subfamily [Caprinae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprinae "Caprinae"). This question becomes a question because there is no such world in English, so if you ask me, I'd say, be it goat or sheep, or even ram or lamb, pick whatever you want. If you are really nitty picky, then I have to say let's call it the year of yang, yes, "yang" exactly as it is, because it is much easily to spell and pronounce than "tsunami". I.e., if we can use a word like "tsunami", why can't we use the word like "yang"?

Ok, now, if this is a Chinese year of **车**, will there be still anyone asking whether it is a year of 汽**车** (car), or 公交**车** (bus), or 越野**车** (SUV), or 卡**车** (truck) or even 脚踏**车** (bicycle) or 马**车** (horse-cart)?

### Goat

[Goat from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat) says:

The **domestic goat** (_Capra aegagrus hircus_) is a subspecies of goat [domesticated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated "Domesticated") from the [wild goat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_goat "Wild goat") of [southwest Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Asia "Southwest Asia") and [Eastern Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe"). The goat is a member of the family [Bovidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovidae "Bovidae") and is closely related to the [sheep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep "Sheep") as both are in the [goat-antelope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat-antelope "Goat-antelope") subfamily [Caprinae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprinae "Caprinae"). There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat#cite_note-hadog-1)

Female goats are referred to as "does" or "nannies", [intact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entire_(animal) "Entire (animal)") males as "bucks", "billies", or "rams" and their [offspring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring "Offspring") are "kids".

### Sheep

[Sheep from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep) says:

**Sheep** (_Ovis aries_) are [quadrupedal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruped "Quadruped"), [ruminant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant "Ruminant") [mammals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal") typically kept as [livestock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock "Livestock"). Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the [even-toed ungulates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-toed_ungulate "Even-toed ungulate"). Although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus _[Ovis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovis "Ovis")_, in everyday usage it almost always refers to _Ovis aries_... An adult female sheep is referred to as a _ewe_, an intact male as a _ram_ or occasionally a _tup_,... and a younger sheep as a _lamb_.
